			I'm a Game Design and Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, so a whole bunch of my time is spent working on class projects, usually programming. I'm also a teachers assistant for a couple classes to help pay the bills, and while grading can be tedious, it's a great feeling to help other students along the path to understanding a topic.

			If I'm not click-clacking away at my keyboard working on classwork or my latest passion project, you can probably find me either drawing, running a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, eating inordinate amounts of food, or protecting humankind from the forces of evil with my pals.
