			I'm a Game Design and Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology, so a whole bunch of my time is spent working on class projects, as well as personal ones. I'm also a teaching assistant - it helps to pay the bills, and it's a great feeling to help other students learn and understand the cool stuff we're taught here at RIT.

			On the off-chance I'm not working on some game, I'm probably playing one! Otherwise, you might find me eating ramen, drinking iced coffee or drawing cool aliens and robots.
