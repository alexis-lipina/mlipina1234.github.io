Originally, without knowing the requirements for project 4, I had considered
making a web-playable version of a Unity game I've been developing for just 
shy of a year, and uploading that, and I wrote my proposal for the game as such.
Due to the restriction of using Javascript, and using either PIXI.js or editing
the DOM directly, I had to come up with a new idea for the game.

I figured it would be relatively easy to implement a sniping game, and it would 
be fun to play if I pulled it off correctly, since I had an enjoyable time playing
web-based sniping games like it in the past. I built off of Circle Blast, keeping 
the circle objects (for the most part), but tweaked many aspects of gameplay. The 
"ship" became the center reticle, and collision with circles doesnt reduce health.
The circles also pick from a list of colors, and the player is assigned one of the 
colors of the currently-active list of circles to kill. It took a good while to get
this to work, as storing a color for comparison is not a simple task. It took a good
bit of stringification and reading PIXI docs to get it to work.

Going forward, if I were to continue working on this, I would probably change the 
graphics a bit so that the targets look more like stick figures than just circles.
I'd add more levels as well, and probably have objects the targets can pass 
behind, or collide with.
