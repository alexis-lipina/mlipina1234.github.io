This portflio was made using Jekyll, a static site generator. It included a number of template functionality
which had a bit of a learning curve, since I was working with someone else's code, and I wanted to create some
of my own functionality with it. 

Examples of specific things I added were...

> The "Portfolio" section, where images are put alongside blocks of text. I used built-in css 
code that basically allows it to toggle between being side by side and on top of each other depending on the 
window size and whether its on mobile or not. The images have links to either a page describing them, eg. Awake(), 
or to a site where you can play the actual game.

> The "About Me" section, which originally did not have an image and just had some brief placeholder text. I modified
it to have the same format of an image aside a block of text.

> The header at the top, including the art and the CSS that makes the text look the way it does. I had to mess with the
template because it originally added a bunch of unnecessary empty space around the text that obscured the portfolio from 
being visible.

> The entire "Resume" section is done by me as well. It's a pretty basic iframe, but took some tweaking to make it look 
good, and I added a link to the pdf so my resume could still be viewable on mobile, which doesnt support iframes.

> I created a page for AWAKE(), a big game project I've been working on. This template site was intended to be used as
a blog, and I reworked a lot of it to make it a portfolio, and this specific page was originally a blog post. I heavily
modified it to suit my needs. It's broken down into an eye-catching title bar, some short descriptions of it, some flashy 
animations and descriptions of the gameplay and technology, and then a section devoted to smaller two-column blocks
describing technical achievements I've accomplished in more detail.

> Some miscellaneous stuff, including adding a favicon, making some art for banners and such, adding in my email to the 
email form, etc. There was a bunch of little things I had to do that I had to figure out on my own.
