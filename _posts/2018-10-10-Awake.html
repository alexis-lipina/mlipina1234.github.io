<h2>A Unique Approach to 2.5D</h2>
<p>
	Visually communicating depth to a player is a challenge, especially with the orthographic "2.5D" perspective many retro games use. Even popular, modern titles such as Hyper Light Drifter struggle with this - despite being comprised of strictly 2D gameplay, players were often confused by the pixel art representations of 3D objects, thinking they could dash onto platforms that weren't actually there.
</p>
<span class="image right" style="max-width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/DepthAndOcclusion.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="As the player jumps up and falls down, areas higher than the player become lighter, and areas below become darker." /></span>
<p>
	In a game like EXALT, where due to the 3D gameplay the communication of this depth is vital to the actual gameplay, this was a problem that could not be overlooked. To attempt to solve this issue, I created a <span style="color:#f0f">shader</span> which creates a "gradient" effect above and below the player, where objects above the player fade to a lighter color, and objects below fade to a darker color.
</p>
<span class="image left" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/ShadowCasting.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Player walks up and down a staircase, and a drop-shadow follows underneath them." /></span>
<p>
	In addition to this, I implemented <span style="color:#f0f">drop-shadows</span> which are cast down from the player and other objects in the world, to help further communicate the position in "3D space" they occupy. Small-scale playtests before and after implementing these features showed marked improvements in player ability to perceive and navigate the space.

<h3><strong>
Combat Systems</strong>
</h3>

<br><hr><br>

<span class="image left" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/ExaltGif.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Demonstration of combat system" /></span>
<p>
	EXALT features a fast-paced real-time <span style="color:#f0f">combat</span> system which encourages aggressive play. The system is simple enough for beginners to get the hang of it quickly and fare well, but featuring the depth that veteran players will want in order to optimize their play and tune their preferred playstyle.
</p>
<span class="image right" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/LightningMoveset.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Demonstration of lightning-based attacks" /></span>
<p>
	One such feature (inspired by Destiny) is the ability to change <span style="color:#f0f">elemental attunement</span> between three options, each featuring unique movesets with interesting abilities. Featured here is the lightning-based moveset, which allows the player to fire lightning bolts at range, and attack enemies with a heavy melee which chains lightning to adjacent enemies. 
</p>
<span class="image left" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/PrimeDetonate.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Demonstration of prime-detonation system" /></span>
<p>
	Another is the ability to <span style="color:#f0f">prime and detonate</span> elemental combos, which was inspired by Mass Effect's biotic combos. Teleporting through an enemy "primes" them. When an enemy is primed, if they are hit with an elemental attack such as a ranged attack, their primes 'detonate, dealing extra damage and sometimes causing interesting effects. Here, the detonation merely deals more damage to the enemy.
</p>
<span class="image right" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/ComboDetonations.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Demonstration of multiple primes detonating" /></span>
<p>
	Furthermore, primes can <span style="color:#f0f">stack</span> if they are of different elements. By changing element, then dashing through the enemy again, the player can leave multiple primes on an enemy which all detonate in unison, stacking the effects of each detonation on the enemy at once.

			Also, I implemented my own <span style="color:#f0f">shadow-casting</span> system, which uses the colliders of the objects the player is over to "slice up" the shadow sprites, done with a combination of some C# scripting and shader magic. It's a minor detail in the game, but I think it really gives it a more authentic look, as opposed to having ellipses just floating around everywhere.

			I made this neat <span style="color:#f0f">procedurally generated lightning bolt VFX</span> to give my ranged attacks a more stylized look. I came up with an algorithm that generates an array of points that, when connected, create a right-angled zigzag from one position to another. I then created another algorithm which generates a set of vertices that are passed into a mesh to actually render the bolt.
