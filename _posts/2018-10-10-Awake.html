<h2>A Unique Approach to 2.5D</h2>
<p>
	Visually communicating depth to a player is a challenge, especially with the orthographic "2.5D" perspective many retro games use. Even popular, modern titles such as Hyper Light Drifter struggle with this - despite being comprised of strictly 2D gameplay, players were often confused by the pixel art representations of 3D objects, thinking they could dash onto platforms that weren't actually there.
</p>
<span class="image right" style="max-width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/DepthAndOcclusion.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="As the player jumps up and falls down, areas higher than the player become lighter, and areas below become darker." /></span>
<p>
	In a game like EXALT, where due to the 3D gameplay the communication of this depth is vital to the actual gameplay, this was a problem that could not be overlooked. To attempt to solve this issue, I created a shader which creates a "gradient" effect above and below the player, where objects above the player fade to a lighter color, and objects below fade to a darker color.
</p>
<span class="image left" style="width: 40%"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/RipplePillars.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Player walks up and down a staircase, and a drop-shadow follows underneath them." /></span>
<p>
	In addition to this, I implemented drop-shadows which are cast down from the player and other objects in the world, to help further communicate the position in "3D space" they occupy. Small-scale playtests before and after implementing these features showed marked improvements in player ability to perceive and navigate the space.

		Here's a short demo of the <span style="color:#f0f">combat</span> in my game, as well as some <span style="color:#f0f">pathfinding</span>. Due to the way my game handles physics, I couldn't use Unity's built-in physics system, so I implemented my own navigation system, using adjacency lists to make the map structure, and pathfinding through the map using A*.

			Also, I implemented my own <span style="color:#f0f">shadow-casting</span> system, which uses the colliders of the objects the player is over to "slice up" the shadow sprites, done with a combination of some C# scripting and shader magic. It's a minor detail in the game, but I think it really gives it a more authentic look, as opposed to having ellipses just floating around everywhere.

			I made this neat <span style="color:#f0f">procedurally generated lightning bolt VFX</span> to give my ranged attacks a more stylized look. I came up with an algorithm that generates an array of points that, when connected, create a right-angled zigzag from one position to another. I then created another algorithm which generates a set of vertices that are passed into a mesh to actually render the bolt.
